# hello-world
My first github repository  
I'm a Music and Computer Science student at UVic, going in to 4th year some time in the future.
I'm a bit apprehensive about getting a computer science co-op. Will I be good enough?
I really hope things go well when I find a co-op. After all, I am competant enough.
Man am I tough on myself sometimes!

Smile!
